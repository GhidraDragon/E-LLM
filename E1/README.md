This is an open repo cuz I'm too lazy to learn how to use the gh cli to sync Ubuntu!!!! you need the training files in the folder before this for it to work Poki!!!!! That's cuz the training data is shared but every new model i go; cd .. && mkdir new && cd new; I'd fix sampling generation to generate 80% as similarly as greedy, as the next step!!!! 

so poki you clone exploitdb in the previous folder

then you download the CVE json zip from MITRE and unzip it as folder name unzipped_cves_json (i think; change if im wrong)

poki...
