So for public repos, we let ChatGPT "blue team?" responding to "red team" and Github to remove if Github deems against their ToS, or if ChatGPT's safety token generator somehow catches generation from your prompt; for manually verified exploits (yes ChatGPT can make mistakes; verify truth before assuming so, dumbass; this is the essence of being alive) then move to private repo.. 

They say ChatGPT can make mistakes; check important info, but how about not assume true until verfied?

You need to cd E1, then run python3.12 E1.py from that directory; it relies on the previous (..) directory for training data. This way you could keep E1, but make a new folder E2 for the next improved model iteration. Model o1 pro was not built overnight; it was build from a list of most-efficient steps.

This one has 3 epochs so it runs comfortably on an RTX 2070 Max-Q Design (nerfed version of the RTX 2070 mobile)

If you're missing the MITRE CVE folder cvelistV5, git clone https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5.git

If you're missing the exploitdb folder, git clone https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb.git

There's either a pentests folder where you place your own insights or exploits for training

I'd also mkdir a Github folder where I clone the repos I enjoy the most, then include those in training, which I'll add for version E2

There's also gigantic PDFs from MITREATTACK while I'll add, for version E2


The one training on my RTX 4070 mobile has 10 epochs, and other upgrades too, including fetching the most recent CVE repos on Github (yes there's basically infinite) and including MITREATTACK etc.
