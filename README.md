This is an open repo cuz I'm too lazy to learn how to use the gh cli to sync Ubuntu!!!! you need the training files in the folder before this for it to work Poki!!!!! That's cuz the training data is shared but every new model i go; cd .. && mkdir new && cd new; I'd fix sampling generation to generate 80% as similarly as greedy, as the next step!!!!
