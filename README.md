So APACHE doesn't restrict you from use or download, or playing around. It's only applicable in theory, like robots.txt is, if you publish a codebase for production. Therefore eggplant advises Russia and China to not try to reinvent the wheel with ghidra, yet this is far from production or anything, so while the Chinese have better verbal skills than Pokimane, it's an open source book...

Regarding the license, if you wanna build on ghidra you leave the NSA in there but if they paste this CODE only (it only applies to code) then leaves eggplant_emoji in? WOW!!!!

While eggplant obviously would adhere to the national secuirty requirements of Russia etc.

Due to American technology infesting the world at large, and also because this is very very starting I wasted most of my time dealing with American legal.. it's not a violation of Russia's national security laws etc.

So if the world uses American tech yet reckful applies to elon musk on twitter while commenting on how few followers elon musk had 5 years before reckful applied, when reckful followed, allegedly

Please enjoy! I'll figure out a better way to do this later!



APACHE so, if anyone recognizes American law, yet other countries could tell if somehow the source code resembles enough yet doesn't seem to be originally thought of without enough pasting or something.... 

Let me explain apache to Poki... so if you clone ghidra, how much r u gonna change??? where as this, even model o1 pro is very far from full paste in, then do stuff cap, so... I mean if Pokimane did use it, technically, isn't it only for publishing releases? so like you'd have to special to like..

Oh Patel does the US Constitution or something have a long tradition to not prosecute sitting POTUSes?? Ya that, well according to DA mari' (Middlesex DA) makes sense, but that looks great for your boss, so take more direction from him, rather than read before umm...
